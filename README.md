MwEclipseAntTools
=================

A collection of utilities for Eclipse, implemented in Ant.  Which
means they can be easily "launched" from the External Tools Launcher.

Everything is set up so that when you add this project to your workspace,
you'll find the following new menu items in the External Tools dropdown menu.

MwEclipseAntTools - open-in-Terminal.xml
-----------------------------------------

Will open a Terminal window in the directory of the resource selected
in the navigator (eg, Package Explorer).

MwEclipseAntTools - open-in-PathFinder.xml
-------------------------------------------

Will open Finder or PathFinder on the directory of the resource selected
in the navigator (eg, Package Explorer).
